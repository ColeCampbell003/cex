Code to clean the CEX FMLI and MTBI files. These were created jointly with Shogher Ohannessian to study spending inequality and follow the code of "Innocent Bystanders? Monetary policy and inequality" by Olivier Coibion, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, Lorenz Kueng, and John Silvia. The MTBI files are used to create a monthly panel of spending. Files should be ran in the following order:

1. p1_cex_fmli_read
2. p2_cex_mtbi_read
3. c1_cex_fmli_clean
4. c1_cex_fmli_clean
5. c3_cex_mtbi_fmli_merge
